hey this is for a project i had to do for university
to test upload the ucf file , the vertical counter and horizontal counter, and the clock divider, (all in the folder (initial test))
once uve got that working , u can upload the other files as u go , along , it ends with a game ive created, 

(u can also upload the bit file that  I have tested and on the board to see if the board is working
also test the VGA cable and monitor before hand)
